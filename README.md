# LARGE-SCALE-CROWD-SIMULATION
Crowd Simulation Analysis  
Introduction  
This project introduces a novel method for analyzing crowd simulation accuracy based on a low-dimensional crowd space. This method provides insightful analysis of various simulation techniques and employs a per-agent, voting-based classifier to predict the most suitable simulation method for different scenarios with high accuracy. Additionally, a modified entropy metric is introduced for localized estimations of simulation accuracy.    
We Calculate Entropy Metric which signifies the simulation accuracy i.e how close the simulation is to the real behaviour.  

im_3 -> calculation of entropy_metric
im_1 -> calculationn with further improvement in entropy metric  
datas folder include datas of all the entropy values, coordinates, state vectores
