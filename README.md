# LARGE-SCALE-CROWD-SIMULATION
Crowd Simulation Analysis
Introduction
This project introduces a novel method for analyzing crowd simulation accuracy based on a low-dimensional crowd space. This method provides insightful analysis of various simulation techniques and employs a per-agent, voting-based classifier to predict the most suitable simulation method for different scenarios with high accuracy. Additionally, a modified entropy metric is introduced for localized estimations of simulation accuracy.
